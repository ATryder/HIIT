HIIT
==================

The first rule of Zombieland; cardio.

HIIT, high intensity interval timer, is a no frills timer for interval training routines, or anything you may need an interval timer for really. You may specify a number of seconds for each active period, a number of seconds for each rest period and, optionally, a number of seconds before the end of each rest period to warn of the upcoming active period giving you time to prepare.
